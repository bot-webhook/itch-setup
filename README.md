# itch-setup

This is the install and self-update helper for [the itch.io app][app]

It applies a few tricks it learned from Squirrel.Mac and Squirrel.Windows, and
uses some of the same technology behind [butler][], itch.io's command line
uploader and patcher. 

[app]: https://itch.io/app
[butler]: https://itch.io/docs/butler

### What does it look like?

Something like this:

This is a screen you should only see the first time you launch the itch.io app,
or if your itch install gets corrupted on disk somehow.

Any upgrades happen seamlessly in the background.
